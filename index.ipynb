    "        <li>While a cell is running a <b>*</b> appears in the square brackets next to the cell. Once the cell has finished running the asterisk will be replaced with a number.</li>\n",
    "        <li>In most cases you'll want to start from the top of notebook and work your way down running each cell in turn. Later cells might depend on the results of earlier ones.</li>\n",
    "        <li>To edit a code cell, just click on it and type stuff. Remember to run the cell once you've finished editing.</li>\n",
